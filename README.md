## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in CSS Grid and responsive design. I learned how to structure a bento grid layout using modern CSS and how to use custom properties for consistent theming. I also practiced using `@font-face` to load local fonts and ensured accessibility and responsiveness across devices.

```css
.bento-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 24px;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my CSS Grid skills and explore more advanced responsive techniques. I also want to experiment with adding subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
